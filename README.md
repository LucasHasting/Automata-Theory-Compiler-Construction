# Automata-Theory-Compiler-Construction
These are the assignments/projects done in my (undergraduate) Automata Theory and Compiler Construction class. The class had a course project where a parser for the PC-0 Langaugae was made, more details of that project are [here](https://github.com/LucasHasting/PC-0-Parser).
